What are ARM Templates?

ARM templates are a form of infrastructure as code, a concept where you define the infrastructure you need to be deployed. 
You no longer need to click around the portal creating virtual machines or writing scripts to deploy a storage account. 
Instead, the template defines the resources, and the Azure ARM management layer is responsible for creating the infrastructure.

This concept is called declarative syntax. 
Declarative syntax is where you state what resources you want to create without writing the sequence of commands to make it. 
For example, you can easily create a script using the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to create a virtual machine. 
However, you have to include lots of logic and error checking to handle any scenario.

Creating a declarative template defines the environment’s end state, and Azure takes the template as input and creates the environment for you. 
The ARM management layer will create a new resource if it doesn’t exist or modify an existing resource if the template is different.

Microsoft has introduced a new infrastructure as code language called Azure Bicep. 

Azure Bicep
===========
Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. 
In a Bicep file, you define the infrastructure you want to deploy to Azure, 
and then use that file throughout the development lifecycle to repeatedly deploy your infrastructure. 
Your resources are deployed in a consistent manner.
